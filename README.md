# PythonCourse (Actosoft) - Lists
Exercises about lists to be resolved using Python. Python Online Course

## Before start coding
- Fork this repo into your Gihub profile.
- Clone the forked repo (repo on your profile, not in Actosoft profile).
- Start coding into the `/exercises` folder.

## While you're coding...
- Commit to your repo each time you finish an exercise.
- The commit message needs to be readable and understandeable. Messages like `done`, `finish` or `exercise one` are not specifics.
- Example of a good commit message:
```
Exercise #n is done. I solved this using a for to loop each element in the list and after that I calculate the average of something.
```

## After coding...
- Ensure all the exercises are solved and the solution works perfectly.
- Ensure all the exercises are on your repo, with the correct name and location.
- Create a Pull Request, from your branch master on your repo, to the master branch of the Actosoft repo (we saw how to do this on Wednesday 8 class 😉).
- Notify to your instructors and run for a beer.


# Exercises

## Find the maximum

Receive two numbers (from keyboard) and print the largest one. If both numbers are the same print a message related to both are the same.

`File name: maximum_value.py`

## Finding Longest Word

Using the following list, you need to find the longest word into the list and print it. If there are 2 or more with the same length, you must print only the first ocurrence.

`File name: longest_word.py`

```
words = [
  'mystery',
  'brother',
  'aviator',
  'crocodile',
  'pearl',
  'orchard',
  'crackpot'
]
```

## Calculating a sum

Using the folowing list, calculate the sum of the numbers into the list and print it. You should print a readable message like `The sum of the numbers is: n`

`File name: sum.py`
```
numbers = [6, 12, 1, 18, 13, 16, 2, 1, 8, 10]
```

## Calculate the Average

You already know how to calculate the average of a group of numbers.

## Jr Level: list of numbers

Find the average of the numbers into the following list

`File name: average_numbers.py`
```
numbers = [2, 6, 9, 10, 7, 4, 1, 9]
```

## Mid Level: list of strings

Find the average length of the following list of strings

`File name: average_strings.py`

```
words = [
    'seat',
    'correspond',
    'linen',
    'motif',
    'hole',
    'smell',
    'smart',
    'chaos',
    'fuel',
    'palace'
]
```

## Unique lists

Using the following list, remove the duplicates values, and print the list without any duplicated.

`File name: unique_lists.py`

```
 words = [
  'crab',
  'poison',
  'contagious',
  'simple',
  'bring',
  'sharp',
  'playground',
  'poison',
  'communion',
  'simple',
  'bring'
]
```

## Finding an element in an list
Lets create a simple searcher.

First, you need to receive from the user the element to search. With that element, search into the following list if the element exist. If it exist, print the position of the element into the list, if not exist print a message like `Element not found` or something like that.

`File name: searcher.py`

```
words = [
  'machine',
  'subset',
  'trouble',
  'starting',
  'matter',
  'eating',
  'truth',
  'disobedience'
]
```

## Counting repetition
First, you need to receive from the user the element to search. This program needs to return the numbers of times that word appears in the list. If the element appears five times, you must print something like `Word: word - Count: 5`. If the element are not in the list, put 0 in the counter.

`File name: words_counter.py`
```
words = [
  'machine',
  'matter',
  'subset',
  'trouble',
  'starting',
  'matter',
  'eating',
  'matter',
  'truth',
  'disobedience'
  'matter'
]
```
